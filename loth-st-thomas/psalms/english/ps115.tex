%1. I have believed, therefore have I spoken; * but I have been humbled exceedingly.

2. I said in my excess: * Every man is a liar.

3. What shall I render to the Lord, * for all the things that he hath rendered to me?

4. I will take the chalice of salvation; * and I will call upon the name of the Lord.

5.  I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people: * precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.

6.  O Lord, for I am thy servant: * I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid.

7. Thou hast broken my bonds: * I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.

8.  I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people: * in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.

9. Glory be to the Father and to the Son * and to the Holy Spirit.

10. As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
