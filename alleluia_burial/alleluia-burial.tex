1. Alleluia, song of sweetness,
    Voice of joy, eternal lay;
    Alleluia is the anthem
    Of the Choirs in Heav’nly day,
    Which the Angels sing, abiding
    In the House of God alway.

2. Alleluia thou resoundest,
    Salem, Mother ever blest;
    Alleluias without ending
    Fit yon place of gladsome rest;
    Exiles we, by Babel’s waters
    Sit in bondage and distress’d.

3. Alleluia we deserve not
    Here to chant forevermore:
    Alleluia our transgressions
    Make us for a while give o’er,
    For the holy time is coming
    Bidding us our sins deplore.

4. Trinity of endless glory,
    Hear Thy people as they cry;
    Grant us all to keep Thy Easter
    In our Home beyond the sky,
    There to Thee our Alleluia
    Singing everlastingly. Amen.

	May Alleluia, that sacred and joyful word, resound to God's praise from the lips of all people. \Rbar.~Amen.
	
	May this word, which expresses glory as chanted by the choirs of angels, be sweet as sung by the voices of the believers. \Rbar.~Amen.
	
	And may that which noiselessly gleams in the citizens of heaven, yield fruit in your hearts by ever-growing love. \Rbar.~Amen.
	
	May the Lord's good angel go with thee, Alleluia; and prepare all good things for thy journey.
	And again come back to us with joy, Alleluia. \Rbar.~Amen.
