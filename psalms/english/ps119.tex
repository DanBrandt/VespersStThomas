1. In my trouble I cried to the Lord: * and he heard me.

2. O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, * and a deceitful tongue.

3. What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, * to a deceitful tongue?

4. The sharp arrows of the mighty, * with coals that lay waste.

5. Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged! I have dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar: * my soul hath been long a sojourner.

6. With them that hated peace I was peaceable: * when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.

7. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.

8. As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
