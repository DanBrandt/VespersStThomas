2. I will sing praises to Thee in the sight of Thy angels: I will worship towards Thy holy temple, and I will give glory to Thy name.
	 
3. For Thy mercy, and for Thy truth: for thou hast magnified Thy holy name above all.
 
4.  In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me: Thou shall multiply strength in my soul.

5. May all the kings of the earth give glory to Thee: for they have heard all the words of Thy mouth.
 
6. And let them sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord.
 
7. For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low: and the high He knoweth afar off.

8. If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, Thou wilt quicken me: and Thou hast stretched forth Thy hand against the wrath of my enemies: and thy right hand hath saved me.
	 
 9. The Lord will repay for me: Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: O despise not the work of Thy hands.

10. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

11. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
