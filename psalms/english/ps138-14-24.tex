2. My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret: and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.
 	
3. Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written: days shall be formed, and no one in them.
 	
4.  But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable: their principality is exceedingly strengthened.
 	
5.  I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand: I rose up and am still with thee.
 	
6. If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God: ye men of blood, depart from me:
 	
7. Because you say in thought: They shall receive thy cities in vain.
 	
8. Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee: and pine away because of thy enemies?

9. I have hated them with a perfect hatred: and they are become enemies to me.
 	
10. Prove me, O God, and know my heart: examine me, and know my paths.
 	
11. And see if there be in me the way of iniquity: and lead me in the eternal way.	
 	
12. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
 	
13. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
