%1. The Lord is faithful in all his words: and holy in all his works.

2. The Lord lifteth up all that fall: and setteth up all that are cast down.

3. The eyes of all hope in thee, O Lord: and thou givest them meat in due season.

4. Thou openest thy hand, and fillest with blessing every living creature.

5. The Lord is just in all his ways: and holy in all his works.

6. The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him: to all that call upon him in truth.

7. He will do the will of them that fear him: and he will hear their prayer, and save them.

8. The Lord keepeth all them that love him; but all the wicked he will destroy.

9. My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless thy holy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever. 

Glory be.
