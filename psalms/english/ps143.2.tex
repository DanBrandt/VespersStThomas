%1. To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee. 

2. Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword: Deliver me.

3. And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity:
and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.

4. Whose sons are as new plants in their youth.
 
5. Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple. 
 
6. Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that.
 
7. Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth: their oxen fat.
 
8. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets. 
 
9. They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord. 

Glory be.
