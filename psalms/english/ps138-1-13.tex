2. Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off: my path and my line thou hast searched out
 	
3. And thou hast foreseen all my ways: for there is no speech in my tongue
 	
4. Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old: thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.
 	
5. Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me: it is high, and I cannot reach to it.
 	
6. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy face?
 	
7. If I ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell, thou art present.
 	
8. If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea:
 	
9. Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
 	
10. And I said: Perhaps darkness shall cover me: and night shall be my light in my pleasures.
 	
11. But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light as day: the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are alike to thee.
 	
12. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast protected me from my mother's womb.
 	
13. I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified: wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.
 	
14 Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
 	
15. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
