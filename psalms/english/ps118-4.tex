1. Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, * in which thou hast given me hope.

2. This hath comforted me in my humiliation: * because thy word hath enlivened me.

3. The proud did iniquitously altogether: * but I declined not from thy law.

4. I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: * and I was comforted.

5. A fainting hath taken hold of me, * because of the wicked that forsake thy law.

6. Thy justifications were the subject of my song, * in the place of my pilgrimage.

7. In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: * and have kept thy law.

8. This happened to me: * because I sought after thy justifications.

9. O Lord, my portion, * I have said, I would keep thy law.

10. I entreated thy face with all my heart: * have mercy on me according to thy word.

11. I have thought on my ways: * and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

12. I am ready, and am not troubled: * that I may keep thy commandments.

13. The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: * but I have not forgotten thy law.

14. I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; * for the judgments of thy justification.

15. I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, * and that keep thy commandments.

16.  The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: * teach me thy justifications.

17. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.

18. As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
