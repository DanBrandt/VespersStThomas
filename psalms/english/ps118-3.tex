2. Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; * and I will keep it with my whole heart.

3. Lead me into the path of thy commandments; * for this same I have desired.

4. Incline my heart into thy testimonies * and not to covetousness.

5. Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: * quicken me in thy way.

6. Establish thy word to thy servant, * in thy fear.

7. Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: * for thy judgments are delightful.

8. Behold I have longed after thy precepts: * quicken me in thy justice.

9. Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: * thy salvation according to thy word.

10. So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; * that I have trusted in thy words.

11. And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: * for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.

12. So shall I always keep thy law, * for ever and ever.

13. And I walked at large: * because I have sought after thy commandments.

14. And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: * and I was not ashamed.

15. I meditated also on thy commandments, * which I loved.

16. And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: * and I was exercised in thy justifications.

17. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.

18. As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
