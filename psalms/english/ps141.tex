2. In his sight I pour out my prayer, and before him I declare my trouble:
	
3. When my spirit failed me, then thou newest my paths. 

4. In this way wherein I walked, they have hidden a snare for me.

5. I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no one that would know me. 

6. Flight hath failed me: and there is no one that hath regard to my soul.

7. I cried to thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my hope, my portion in the land of the living.

8. Attend to my supplication: for I am brought very low. 

9. Deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

10. Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the just wait for me, until thou reward me.

11. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
 	
12. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
