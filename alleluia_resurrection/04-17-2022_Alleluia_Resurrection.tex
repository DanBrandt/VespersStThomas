 \textit{1. The Lamb's high banquet we await in snow-white robes of royal state: and now, the Red Sea's channel past, to Christ our Prince we sing at last.}\\
\textit{2. Upon the Altar of the Cross His Body hath redeemed our loss: and tasting of his roseate Blood, our life is hid with Him in God.}\\
\textit{3. That Paschal Eve God's arm was bared, the devastating Angel spared: by strength of hand our hosts went free from Pharaoh's ruthless tyranny.}\\
\textit{4. Now Christ, our Paschal Lamb, is slain, the Lamb of God that knows no stain, the true Oblation offered here, our own unleavened Bread sincere.}\\
\textit{5. O Thou, from whom hell's monarch flies, O great, O very Sacrifice, Thy captive people are set free, and endless life restored in Thee.}\\
\textit{6. For Christ, arising from the dead, from conquered hell victorious sped, and thrust the tyrant down to chains, and Paradise for man regains.}\\
\textit{7. We pray Thee, King with glory decked, in this our Paschal joy, protect from all that death would fain effect Thy ransomed flock, Thine own elect.}\\
\textit{8. To Thee who, dead, again dost live, all glory Lord, Thy people give; all glory, as is ever meet, to Father and to Paraclete. Amen.}
